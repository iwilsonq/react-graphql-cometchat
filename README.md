## Running the demo

To run the demo follow these steps:

### Create your API keys

- Head to CometChat Pro and create an account
- From the dashboard, create a new app called "React GraphQL Messenger"
- When created, click Explore
- Go to the API Keys tab and click Create API Key
- Create an API key called "React GraphQL Messenger Key" with Full Access

### Run the source code

- Download the repository here or by running git clone https://github.com/iwilsonq/react-graphql-cometchat.git and open it in your text editor of choice
- Update `index.js` and `client/src/config.js` with your newly created appID and apiKey
- Run the following commands in two separate tabs

```sh
# in project root directory
npm install && npm start

# in client/ directory
npm install && npm start
```

You should now have a GraphQL server running at http://localhost:4000 and a React app dev server at http://localhost:3000.
