- Create an API key called "React GraphQL Messenger Key" with Full Access

### Run the source code

- Download the repository here or by running git clone https://github.com/iwilsonq/react-graphql-cometchat.git and open it in your text editor of choice
- Update `index.js` and `client/src/config.js` with your newly created appID and apiKey
- Run the following commands in two separate tabs

```sh
